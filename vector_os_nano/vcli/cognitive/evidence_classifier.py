"""evidence_classifier — separate GROUNDED verify predicates from RAN (no real,
non-tautological world evidence).

R1 of the Campaign-#13 honest-verification redesign. The legacy evidence gate
short-circuited ``if is_robot: return True``, auto-passing every robot step
regardless of its verify result. The honest replacement keys verification on
whether the deterministic verify expression actually reads world state in a way
the ACTOR (which authors the verify string) cannot trivially satisfy.

Foolability axis (2026-06-18 red-team): a verify string is real evidence only when
it CONSUMES a sim/world oracle AND is not a tautology the author can make true by
choice of string. Two oracle kinds:

- PREDICATE oracles (bool, goal-conditioned; the author supplies the goal as
  arguments, e.g. ``at_position(2.0, 0.0)``, ``arm_at_home()``): a BARE call is
  GROUNDED — it is True only if the world actually reached that goal.
- STATE oracles (return raw values, e.g. ``get_position()``, ``describe_scene()``):
  a bare call is NOT evidence (always truthy / shape-trivial); it is GROUNDED only
  inside a comparison against a CONSTANT (``placed_count() == 2``,
  ``'table' in describe_scene()``).

The GROUNDED test requires the oracle's RESULT to GATE the verdict — every
truth-bearing leaf of the boolean expr must be an oracle term (``_is_grounded_node``,
recursive). A constant/non-oracle operand that could short-circuit the verdict True
(``at_position(99,99) or True``, ``... or 1``) classifies RAN (2026-06-19 review hole).

SCOPE (honest — do not overclaim): this is a STRUCTURAL guard only. It does NOT
verify that the constant is the TASK's real goal (an author could still write
``at_position(<current coords>)``), nor catch shape-trivial state compares
(``len(get_position()) == 3``), nor — for NON-robot predicates — that the actor
CAUSED the state (a dev ``file_exists('/etc/passwd')`` with no write classifies
GROUNDED). Goal AUTHENTICITY / actor-causation for state+dev predicates is DEFERRED
to the actor-causation layer, which today grades only ROBOT predicates (base/arm/
gripper). R1 rejects the obvious tautologies (no oracle; oracle-vs-itself; bare state
oracle; truthy-constant short-circuit) so the moat is not a NEW false-green dressed
up as verification.
