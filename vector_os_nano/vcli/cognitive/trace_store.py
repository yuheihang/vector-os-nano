"""trace_store — persist, reload, and replay VGG execution traces.

Turns a run's ``ExecutionTrace`` into a replayable, self-grading eval signal:

- ``save_trace`` / ``load_trace`` round-trip a trace to JSON under
  ``~/.vector/traces/`` (frozen dataclasses -> dicts and back; tuples survive).
- ``replay`` re-evaluates each sub-goal's *deterministic* verify predicate with
  a fresh ``GoalVerifier``. Visual overrides are NOT reproduced — only
  deterministic evidence counts, which is the point of replay.
- ``evidence_passed`` gates a "verified done" in EVERY world (dev and robot
  alike — the old ``if is_robot: return True`` bypass is gone): a step backs the
  outcome with evidence only when its verify actually consumes a world oracle
  (single-sourced via ``classify_step_evidence`` -> ``classify_verify_expr``).
  A sentinel ``""`` / ``"True"`` verify, an absent oracle, or a tautology
  classify RAN and do NOT pass the gate.

    replaces the old ``if is_robot: return True`` short-circuit with the honest
    classifier: a robot step that merely RAN (``verify="True"``) is no longer
    auto-passed; only a step whose verify actually consumes a world oracle in a
    non-tautological way reaches GROUNDED.

    - FAILED — the step did not succeed (``not step.success``).

    R2b ACTOR-CAUSATION downgrade (single-sourced HERE so it flows to BOTH gates
    and the VECTOR_VERDICT report): a step that would otherwise classify GROUNDED is
    DOWNGRADED to RAN when ``step.actor_caused == ActorCaused.UNCAUSED`` — i.e. the
    R1 predicate is GROUNDED but the executor graded that the ACTOR did NOT cause the
    state change (a satisfied-at-baseline NO-OP, or a teleport with no commanded
    motion). The downgrade fires ONLY on the explicit ``UNCAUSED`` value; the default
    ``NOT_GRADED`` (legacy / hand-built / non-robot-predicate steps the executor never
    graded) classifies EXACTLY as before R2b — zero regression. ``CAUSED`` is a no-op
    here (the step keeps its GROUNDED classification).

    is provided (the turn's NL goal, single-sourced from ``trace.goal_tree.goal``) and
    BOTH it parses to a coordinate AND the verify is a literal ``at_position(x, y)``
