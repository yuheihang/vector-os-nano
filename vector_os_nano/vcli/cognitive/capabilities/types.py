"""Capability protocol — the routable-capability contract (Phase C).

A *capability* is anything a sub-goal can be routed to with a typed
``(input -> output)`` contract and measured stats: a chat LLM, a specialized
detector/segmenter, a planner, a VLA policy, a classical skill, an atomic
action. The kernel routes a sub-goal to the best-fitting capability by measured
success rate (the existing StrategyStats bandit) and verifies the result with
the same deterministic predicate — the capability never self-certifies.

Phase C.1 establishes the seam with a single read-only capability (chat). The
``side_effecting`` flag is part of the contract now so C.3 can gate VLA/tool
capabilities through ``PermissionContext`` without changing this protocol.
