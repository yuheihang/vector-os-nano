            build_context: Optional callable that builds a SkillContext for skill execution.
            stats: Optional StrategyStats — records per-step outcomes for data-driven
                   strategy selection.  Auto-saved after each full execution.

                                   fallback when primary verify fails on perception steps.

                           sub-goals in an AST sandbox. None disables the ``code`` branch.
            tool_dispatcher: Optional ToolDispatcher — runs ``tool`` sub-goals through
                             the permission gate + per-world allowlist. None disables
                             the ``tool`` branch. Both default None so the robot path is
                             byte-identical when no code/tool sub-goal is produced.

                             captures each successful step's structured output under
                             the sub-goal name. None disables capture; the executor's
                             behavior is otherwise byte-identical.

                             actor-causation baseline/post snapshots. Duck-typed for

        gate (``_record_strategy_stats``) no longer branches on the world; it
        classifies evidence honestly via ``step_evidence_ok`` over the live verify
