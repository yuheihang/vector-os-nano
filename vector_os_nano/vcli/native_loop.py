"""native_loop — a frontier-model NATIVE TOOL-USE turn producer (strangler-fig core).

Campaign #13, M1 FIRST STEP. This is the producer half of the strangle move: the
MODEL drives a native tool-use ReAct loop (skills-as-tools + a synthetic
``verify(expr)`` + ``finish``), and the loop assembles an ``ExecutionTrace`` the
EXISTING honest verify spine consumes BYTE-FOR-BYTE UNCHANGED. It does NOT compute
``verified`` itself — it hands the trace to ``VerdictReport.from_trace`` /
``evidence_passed`` (rule 5: verify is the moat, single-sourced).

REPLACE-NOT-REBUILD, enforced BY CONSTRUCTION (review fix 5):

    This module imports ONLY the honest spine — ``actor_causation``,
    ``trace_store`` (the verdict + oracle names live one hop further), the
    GoalVerifier namespace builder (via the engine, passed in), and
    ``SkillWrapperTool``. It MUST NOT import ``goal_decomposer`` / ``goal_executor``
    / ``strategy_selector`` / ``vgg_harness``. ``tests/unit/vcli/test_native_loop
    _import_firewall.py`` FAILS if any of those appear in this module's imports.
    The runner's ONLY logic is: capture baseline -> dispatch the skill via
    SkillWrapperTool -> evaluate verify via the live GoalVerifier -> grade via
    ``actor_causation.grade`` -> append ONE StepRecord. The MODEL owns
    decompose / route / replan — there is NO replan / iteration / "landed-short"
    bookkeeping here (that would be re-growing the planner — the tell).

StepRecord granularity (review fix 2): EXACTLY ONE StepRecord per
(action-chain -> verify) pair. Intermediate bare skill calls between two
``verify`` calls are NOT each a checked sub-goal and are NOT sentinel-verified
(that would re-open the no-op/teleport hole). The ``verify`` tool HANDLER is what
appends the StepRecord, binding the just-run skill calls as the producing action
and the model's expr as the SubGoal.verify.

Capture/grade timing (review fix 3), mirroring ``GoalExecutor._execute_sub_goal``:
the actor-causation baseline is captured immediately BEFORE the first skill call
of a step; the grade reads a FRESH post-capture immediately AFTER evaluating that
step's verify expr, NEVER spanning a later step's actions (else the go2 daemon's
between-turn motion folds into the causation grade).
