"""Deterministic sim-oracle verify predicates over a connected mobile base.

The go2 counterpart of ``arm_sim_oracle``: these are the callables a base
sub-goal's ``verify`` expression evaluates against. They read the sim's
DETERMINISTIC ground truth off the connected base — ``get_position`` /
``get_heading`` — never the VLM (ADR-008: generator and verifier independent).

Single-sourced HERE in the kernel so BOTH the playground go2 world AND the plain
``RobotWorld`` can consume them without the kernel importing the playground
(ADR-008 / kernel rule 2: the dependency edge is one-way, playground -> kernel).
``playground/verify/base_predicates.py`` is a thin re-export shim.

Grounding contract:
- The base is reached from the agent via ``getattr(agent, "_base", None)`` (the
  same accessor the engine's SkillContext builder and robot_context use). When
  the base is absent or not connected, every predicate FAILS SAFE (returns
  ``False``) — it must NEVER raise into the GoalVerifier sandbox.
- Each predicate is a thin factory bound to the connected ``agent`` (and, for
  ``visited``, the scenario's named rooms), so a world can drop them straight
  into the verify namespace.

The predicates are side-effect-free: position / heading reads do not advance the
sim. A "room" is an axis-aligned bounding box owned by the scenario; ``visited``
checks the base's current xy against a named room's box.

    Deterministic and fail-safe: an empty / malformed room map yields
