"""Shared tool-execution seam (Stage 5, S5.1).

ONE place that runs the permission gate for a single resolved tool and then
executes it, returning a neutral ``PermissionDecision`` + a ``ToolResult``. Both
planning paths call this so the permission/ask/execute core can never drift:

- the ReAct tool loop (``VectorEngine._execute_single_tool``), and
- the VGG ``tool`` sub-goal path (``ToolDispatcher.dispatch``).

This is an *additive* extraction (S5.1): both callers keep their own public entry
points and their own caller-specific concerns. Only the duplicated gate+execute
core lives here. The pieces that legitimately differ between the two callers are
passed in as parameters/strategy — they are NOT collapsed into one behaviour:

- **Allowlist + registry lookup** stay in each caller (the VGG side enforces a
  per-world allowlist before lookup; the ReAct side does not). By the time this
  seam runs, the caller has already resolved a concrete ``tool`` object.
- **Hooks + streaming callbacks** (``on_tool_start`` / ``on_tool_end`` / pre/post
  tool hooks) are the ReAct side's concern; the caller wraps this function with
  them. The seam itself stays pure (no hook firing) so the VGG side — which has
  no hooks — is unaffected.
- **Error-string shaping and the return shape** stay in each caller (ReAct returns
  a rich ``ToolCall`` + a tool-result dict; VGG returns ``(success, error)``).
  This seam returns a neutral ``PermissionDecision`` whose ``kind`` each caller
  maps to its own wording and ``permission_action`` label.
- **Robustness of the permission machinery itself** (whether a raised
  ``permissions.check`` or a raised ``add_always_allow`` is swallowed) is a
  strategy flag, because the two callers legitimately differ: the VGG path runs
  autonomously and fails closed on a buggy resolver/permission object, whereas the
  ReAct path lets such a programming error surface.

The permission *decision* itself (the 7-layer ``PermissionContext.check`` plus the
deny-by-default ``ask`` resolution) is identical for both, which is exactly the
duplication this removes.
