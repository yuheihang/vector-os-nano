"""verdict — the machine-checkable acceptance signal for a single cli.main turn.

This is the acceptance INSTRUMENT for the orchestration redesign. The honest
verdict the engine already computes for a VGG run
(``evidence_passed(trace, verify_oracle_names(agent, engine))``) previously NEVER
escaped cli.main as a machine signal — the REPL only ``console.print``ed Rich
prose. ``VerdictReport`` turns that exact same computation into a frozen,
JSON-serializable record so a non-interactive ``-p/--json`` turn can emit ONE
stdout line a harness asserts against.

Honesty by construction (CLAUDE.md rule 5 — verify is the moat):
``VerdictReport.from_trace`` re-uses the EXISTING ``classify_step_evidence`` /
``evidence_passed`` from ``trace_store`` for EVERY field — it NEVER re-derives a
verdict with its own logic. The contract test pins this:

    VerdictReport.from_trace(trace, oracle_names).verified
        == evidence_passed(trace, oracle_names)

so the machine signal can only ever AGREE with the gate the engine itself uses.
An empty oracle set, a sentinel ``""``/``"True"`` verify, an absent oracle, a
tautology, or a VLM visual override all classify RAN (not GROUNDED), so the
signal fails CLOSED — the moat only ever gets stricter.
