"""PerceptionGraspSkill — the honest, perception-driven Go2+Piper grasp.

This is the skill the North Star calls for: the robot LOCALIZES the target the
way a real robot must — perceive it — instead of reading the simulator's
omniscient object table.

Pipeline (the goal, verbatim):
    VLM 识别 (Moondream bbox)
      -> EdgeTAM 分割 (binary mask)
      -> pointcloud 取中点 (mask + REAL rendered depth -> camera-frame centroid
         -> world via the exact MuJoCo cam->world transform)   [grasp_point.py]
      -> IK + grasp motion (REUSES the proven PickTopDownSkill via its
         params['target_xyz'] seam — no re-implemented motion)
      -> verify  holding_object('<name>')

Contrast with PickTopDownSkill (skills/pick_top_down.py): that skill reads the
object's world pose from a pre-populated world model (ground truth). This skill
NEVER does — the 3D grasp point comes only from depth + mask. If perception
fails (no detection / empty mask / no depth points) it FAILS LOUD with a precise
diagnosis; it must NEVER silently substitute a ground-truth pose to stay green
(that re-fakes perception, the exact thing the goal forbids).

The verify oracle holding_object('<name>') stays ground-truth and BYTE-UNCHANGED
(it is the moat oracle the actor cannot author): the skill only EMITS the verify
string, it never imports/evaluates the oracle or feeds the centroid into it.
