"""PlaygroundWorld — a parallel-track world for tabletop arm + Go2 base scenarios.

The playground is a SEPARATE world track (ADR-008). It integrates with the
kernel ONLY across the versioned public contract: the four registrations (tools,
verify namespace, decompose vocab, persona) plus the verified-loop observation
surface. The dependency edge is strictly ONE-WAY: this package imports the kernel
(``vcli.worlds.base``) + ``hardware``/``skills``; the kernel never imports the
playground except through the world registry's lazy hook.

The playground reuses the robot persona and single-sources its decompose
vocabulary from the skill registry (like ``RobotWorld``). Its distinct, owned
contribution is the verify namespace: deterministic sim-oracle predicates. The
predicate set is chosen by the scenario's embodiment — ARM scenarios (tabletop)
contribute arm/scene predicates over the connected arm + known objects; the GO2
scenario (a mobile-base quadruped, ``has_base``) contributes base predicates
(at_position / facing / visited) over the connected base. This proves the seam
generalizes across embodiments with no embodiment-specific code in the kernel.
