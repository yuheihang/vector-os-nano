# frame. These are the scenario-owned contract the base ``visited`` predicate
# reads against — a navigation sub-goal verifies "reached <room>" by name, and
# the GO2 rooms producer (PlaygroundWorld.ROOMS_STRATEGY) emits exactly this set
# as the list a "visit each room one by one" foreach iterates.
#
# REAL GEOMETRY — reconciled with the bundled scene_room.xml (the 20m x 14m house;
# see its top-down ASCII layout + ``f_*`` floor geoms). Each box is the room's
# floor extent in the world frame, derived directly from the matching ``f_<room>``
# plane geom ``pos +/- size`` (e.g. ``f_kitchen`` pos="17 2.5" size="3 2.5" =>
# (14, 0, 20, 5)). The Go2 spawns at (10, 3, 0.35) (MuJoCoGo2._reset sets
# data.qpos[0:3] = [10, 3, 0.35]) — inside the central ``hallway`` box. The
# hallway is the open central span (x=6..14, y=0..10) the perimeter rooms open
# onto; the bathroom box spans x=7..12 because the laundry was merged into it
# (see the XML's "LAUNDRY (merged into bathroom)" section). Room centres here
# match the canonical navigation room database in
# tests/unit/test_navigate_skill_nav2.py (kitchen=(17, 2.5), hallway=(10, 5),
# master_bedroom=(3.5, 12), ...). The mechanism (producer -> foreach -> visited)
