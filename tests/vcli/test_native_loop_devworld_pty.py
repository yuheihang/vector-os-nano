"""M1 STEP 6 (C) — native producer in the DEV world: the action leak is now CLOSED.

Steps 1-2 + 3A-B proved the native producer covers the go2 ACTION surface (walk,
turn -> at_position, facing). The legacy planner's other job is being WORLD-AGNOSTIC:
the same loop must ACT in the dev world too (write a file, run a tool) and prove it
with a dev verify predicate. Step 3 documented a REAL FINDING — through the REAL
``cli.main --native-loop`` PTY the native loop offered NO dev action tools, so a dev
``file_write`` was an "Unknown tool" -> RAN / exit 2. STEP 6 CLOSES that leak; this
module now PINS the fix.

THE LEAK (was) AND THE FIX (now):

    ``native_loop._build_motor_tools(agent)`` USED to build the loop's action surface
    from ``wrap_skills(agent)`` ONLY. In the dev world ``cli._init_agent`` returns
    ``None`` (no ``--sim``/``--sim-go2``), so there was no agent and no skill registry:
    the loop offered ONLY ``verify`` + ``finish`` and ZERO action tools. STEP 6 extends
    ``_build_motor_tools(agent, engine)`` to ALSO surface the engine registry's
    ``code``-category tools (file_read/file_write/file_edit/bash/glob/grep — the SAME
    set the legacy dev path dispatches via ``DEV_TOOL_ALLOWLIST`` + ``ToolDispatcher``).
    These are real ``Tool`` objects whose ``.execute(params, ctx)`` is the interface
    ``dispatch_skill`` already calls. World-agnostic BY CONSTRUCTION: native asks the
    ENGINE'S registry for its registered action tools — no "if dev" branch in the spine.
    So a dev write-then-verify script through ``cli.main --native-loop`` now dispatches
    ``file_write`` for real, writes the file, and ``path_contains`` reads True ->
    GROUNDED / verified True / exit 0.

This was never a spine/grading defect (the verify spine, the dev predicates, and the
GROUNDED classification all worked — ``path_contains`` is a PREDICATE oracle and grades
GROUNDED on a True read). It was purely the missing dev ACTION surface; the fix wires
the kernel "code" toolset native already had access to via the engine.

THE PRODUCER IS WORLD-AGNOSTIC (the second test, unchanged, still proves it): when a
dev action is wrapped as a skill onto an agent, ``run_turn_native`` dispatches it, the
file is written, and ``verify(path_contains(...))`` grades GROUNDED / verified True /
exit 0 through the UNTOUCHED spine.

This file needs NO live key and NO sim (it is a dev PTY + an in-process run). Reproduce::
