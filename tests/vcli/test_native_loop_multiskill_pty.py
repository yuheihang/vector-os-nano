"""M1 STEP 3 (A) — native producer SUBSUMES a SECOND distinct (skill, predicate).

Step 1 (``test_native_loop_trichotomy_pty.py``) proved ONE motor skill + ONE
predicate route through ``run_turn_native`` (walk -> at_position). The legacy
planner's job is broader: it routes MANY distinct skills to MANY distinct verify
predicates. Before any legacy deletion we must show the native producer covers more
of that surface. This module is the multi-skill proof on the REAL go2 sim:

    [walk forward ~2m]  -> verify(at_position(11.0, 3.0))   -> GROUNDED + CAUSED
    [turn left]         -> verify(facing(<start+90deg>))     -> GROUNDED + CAUSED
    finish

A SCRIPTED ``FakeToolScriptBackend`` replays the two action->verify pairs (the same
deterministic seam the trichotomy teleport case uses), so the test is network-free,
but the ACTIONS run on a REAL ``MuJoCoGo2`` base and the trace is graded by the
UNTOUCHED honest spine (``VerdictReport.from_trace`` + ``verify_oracle_names``). The
second pair (skill ``turn`` -> predicate ``facing``) is what proves the producer
subsumes a distinct (skill, predicate) the first acceptance never exercised:

  - ROUTING: per-step strategy is the producing skill — ``walk`` then ``turn`` (never
    ``navigate``, which is gated out of actor-causation and not offered as a tool);
  - PREDICATE: each verify names the registry-derived oracle that MEASURES that
    goal — ``at_position`` for a position, ``facing`` for a heading;
  - CAUSATION: a real forward walk grades the ``at_position`` step CAUSED (planar
    channel); a real yaw command + yaw displacement grades the ``facing`` step CAUSED
    (R2b's ``_BASE_PREDICATES`` includes ``facing``, graded PER-CHANNEL on the heading
    delta — a forward walk's planar move does NOT count for facing). [STEP-12 fix]

GAIT UNDER-ROTATION (empirical, documented honestly): the MPC gait achieves only
about HALF its commanded yaw within the step's wall-clock (a commanded 180deg turn
lands ~85deg of real yaw) — the rotational analogue of the walk skill under-shooting
its commanded distance. So to actually FACE start+90deg (within ``facing``'s 20deg
tol) the script COMMANDS a 180deg left turn, exactly as the walk command over-shoots
distance to land within ``at_position``'s tol. The verify target is a clean
start+90deg heading (NOT the achieved heading — we never author the goal to match the
outcome); the over-command is the honest way the gait reaches it. The target heading
is computed from the base's ACTUAL heading read BEFORE the run, so the test is
self-calibrating to whatever pose ``stand()`` settles into.
