"""M1 STEP 4 (A) — native producer SUBSUMES a THIRD capability class: ARM/GRIPPER.

Steps 1-3 proved the native producer routes + grades the go2 BASE capability
(walk->at_position, turn->facing, multi-leg journeys). The legacy planner's job
is broader still: it routes the MANIPULATION class too. Before any legacy deletion
we must show the native producer covers that surface as well. This module is the
arm/gripper proof on the REAL SO-101 arm sim:

    [pick banana, mode=hold]  -> verify(holding_object('banana'))  -> GROUNDED + CAUSED
    finish

A SCRIPTED ``FakeToolScriptBackend`` replays the single (action -> verify) pair (the
same deterministic seam the multiskill test uses), so the test is network-free, but
the PICK runs on a REAL ``MuJoCoArm`` + ``MuJoCoGripper`` base and the trace is
graded by the UNTOUCHED honest spine (``VerdictReport.from_trace`` +
``verify_oracle_names``). The (skill ``pick`` -> predicate ``holding_object``) pair
is what proves the producer subsumes the arm/gripper class the base acceptances
never exercised:

  - ROUTING: the step's strategy is the producing skill — ``pick`` (a manipulation
    skill, never a base motion skill);
  - PREDICATE: the verify names the registry-derived GRIPPER oracle that MEASURES
    the goal — ``holding_object`` (was the requested object grasped), not a base
    position/heading oracle;
  - CAUSATION: a real grasp toggles the banana's weld constraint 0->1, which
    R2b's ``_GRIPPER_PREDICATES`` grades CAUSED via ``gripper.weld_is_active()`` (a
    fresh weld transition this step). This is a DISTINCT causation channel from the
    base steps (commanded |cmd| + pose displacement) — the gripper-weld channel.

MOAT-HONEST CHOICE — pick, not home (a real, verified finding):
The SO-101 ``MuJoCoArm`` exposes NO ``ctrl_motion`` instrumentation (only the
go2-mounted ``MuJoCoPiper`` does), so an ``arm_at_home`` step grades UNCAUSED on
this sim (``ActorBaseline.arm_ctrl_motion`` is None -> ``grade`` fails closed). The
GRIPPER channel does NOT depend on ``ctrl_motion`` — it reads the live weld state —
so PICK -> ``holding_object`` is the cleanly-CAUSED capability here. The arm boots
NOT holding anything (every ``<weld ... active="false">`` in so101_mujoco.xml), so a
real grasp is a genuine 0->1 transition BY THE ACTOR: a true caused state change,
not a satisfied-at-baseline NO-OP.

SIM DISCIPLINE: serialized (one sim), headless, MuJoCo closed + rosm nuke after the
case via the fixture. The arm sim does NOT write its scene xml (verified), so no
scene restore is needed. Reproduce::
