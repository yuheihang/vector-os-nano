"""R2-7 long-chain regression: the detect -> foreach -> pick producer/consumer contract.

A "grab everything" plan decomposes to a detect step followed by a ``foreach`` over
the detected objects, whose body binds a per-item field into the pick param
(e.g. ``object_label="${item.name}"``). The robot-world ``DetectSkill`` historically
produced objects keyed by ``label`` only, while the decompose foreach example (and the
playground detect producer) reference ``${item.name}`` — so the binding silently failed
("Cannot locate target object") and the whole grab-everything chain broke on the first
item. The fix makes DetectSkill expose BOTH ``name`` and ``label`` so the binding
resolves whichever field the planner emits. This test guards that contract.
