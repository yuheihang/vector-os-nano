"""Playground (INC6, PART B) — the REAL headless MuJoCoArm sim-oracle guard.

The fakes in ``test_playground_chain.py`` / ``test_playground_predicates.py``
only prove the predicates' *logic*; they cannot prove the fake oracle SHAPE
matches the real arm. This test instantiates the REAL ``MuJoCoArm(gui=False)``
headless on the bundled ``so101_mujoco.xml`` and asserts the sim-oracle contract
the playground predicates depend on:

- ``get_object_positions()`` returns the six known tabletop objects,
- ``arm_at_home()`` (the playground predicate) is True after the arm is driven to
  the home pose,
- ``detect_objects()`` (the scene predicate over the oracle) returns the object
  list.

POLLUTION SAFETY (critical):
This file is collected by the canonical ``tests/vcli tests/unit/vcli`` gate, so
it MUST NOT destabilise it. The known failure mode is MUJOCO_GL cross-test
pollution. We guard against it two ways:

1. The test only uses PHYSICS (mj_forward / mj_step) — never rendering — so it
   needs no GL backend. We pin ``MUJOCO_GL=disable`` (valid on macOS/Linux) for
   the duration and RESTORE the prior value in a finally block, so the env is
   left exactly as found for every other test in the run.
2. It is marked ``@pytest.mark.integration`` so it can be deselected
   (``-m "not integration"``) in environments where mujoco is unavailable, and
   ``pytest.importorskip`` skips cleanly when the wheel is missing.

Run it in isolation with:
    .venv-nano/bin/python -m pytest tests/vcli/test_playground_real_arm.py -q
