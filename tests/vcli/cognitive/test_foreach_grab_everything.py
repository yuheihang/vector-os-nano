"""S4-3 — "grab everything, one by one" END-TO-END (Stage 4 acceptance).

This is the core Stage-4 acceptance: prove a FOREACH long-chain runs end-to-end
on the tabletop playground scenario, through the REAL kernel pieces:

  NL -> GoalDecomposer (mock backend, ARM-ONLY validation)
     -> GoalExecutor (real topo-sort + foreach expansion)
     -> GoalVerifier (real AST sandbox)
     over the MERGED PlaygroundWorld sim-oracle verify namespace
     against a DETERMINISTIC stub arm that advances state so each per-step
     verify (holding_object() / placed_count(...)) flips False->True as the
     chain progresses.

The decomposed chain is:

    scan -> detect_all -> foreach(obj in detected objects): pick(obj) -> place(obj)

ASSERTIONS (the Stage-4 acceptance bar):
  - decompose is ARM-ONLY: no go2/base strategies, no hallucinated skills.
  - the dynamic tree's leaf (pick/place) count EQUALS the detected object count.
  - every per-step verify passes (deterministic predicate, no visual override).
  - the run reaches verified-done (trace.success).
  - the observation snapshot is JSON-safe and reflects the EXPANDED steps.

Hermetic: mock backend, no live LLM, no MuJoCo. The stub arm/gripper mirror the
sim-oracle's grounding contract (get_object_positions / get_joint_positions / fk
/ gripper.is_holding) exactly as the real arm exposes them, so the SAME
playground predicates that run against MuJoCo run here unchanged.
