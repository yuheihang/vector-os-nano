"""Step 3 — LLM-side grasp generalization: per-skill verify_hint + entity binding.

These are DETERMINISTIC teaching-signal tests (NO network / NO live LLM). They
assert the SHAPE of what the planner is taught and that a correctly-bound plan
PASSES the decompose validator — never model behaviour:

  1. ``Skill.to_schemas()`` surfaces each arm skill's declared ``verify_hint``
     (pick -> holding_object(), home -> arm_at_home(), detect ->
     len(detect_objects()) > 0, place -> not holding_object()).
  2. ``build_decompose_vocab`` derives, world-agnostically:
       - per-strategy ``suggested verify:`` lines in strategy_params_help,
       - a few-shot example whose verify expression IS a skill's verify_hint,
       - an object-ish param shown BOUND (non-empty) in that example so the
         planner learns the shape of binding a task target,
       - a planner_intro carrying the bind-the-target + prefer-suggested-verify
         guidance.
  3. A hand-written pick plan (strategy_params={"object_label": "banana"},
     verify "holding_object()") PASSES decompose validation against an arm
     vocab whose allowlist includes holding_object — the strategy is kept, the
     verify is not cleared, and validation_notes is empty.
